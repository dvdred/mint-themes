# Customization

## - Fixed syntax for conky version released with Linux Mint 18
## - Fixed visualization distorsion
## - Customized color of some elements, included graph

# NB: YOU MUST CHANGE
## - the default "wlp3s0" name of the network interfaces inside the main cofiguration, unless you will see "0" as resulting data
## - the default "/share" and "/DATA" folder watched in the same files.

### Many Thanks to the author of the original theme. You can include my fixes if you wish.
